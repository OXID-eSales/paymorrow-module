If You have many sub-shops and more languages than English and German,
please see comments in docs/install.sql to install all CMS snippets manually.

If Your shop version is 4.7.6/5.0.6 or older, You need to merge an admin template for module settings to extend:
 - Merge an example template from the module changed_full/application/views/admin/tpl/module_config.tpl
   with eShop template located in application/views/admin/tpl/module_config.tpl
 - Clear the cache by removing tmp/ folder content (all except .htaccess file)
Basically it is about adding a block named "admin_module_config_form" to the template.

==Extend==
 * order
  -- render
  -- _getNextStep
 * oxbasket
 * oxbasketitem
 * oxorder
  -- finalizeOrder
 * oxpayment
  -- isValidPayment
 * oxpaymentgateway
  -- executePayment
 * oxuser
 * oxuserpayment
